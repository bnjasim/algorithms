## CKY algorithm for Probabilistic Context Free Grammar

Given a probabilistic Context Free Grammar in Chomsky Normal Form as input, the algorithm will find the most probable parse tree for an input sentence. If the sentence is not in the language it will print so.

To run, type
`python cky.py g7.txt test7.txt`
