# Algorithms
Implementation of several algorithms (in python mostly but includes other languages as well) with a focus on AI. This repository is not inteded to be a comprehensive resource of algorithms, rather a place to keep my implementations for future reference!

Machine learning algorithms will go into its own repository: github.com/bnjasim/machine-learning
